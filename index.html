        <p>Hello! My name is Jacob'm Aniterea. I was born in the Cook Islands, a small island nation
            in the South Pacific. I was raised in Auckland, New Zealand and currently live in Perth,
            Australia. I enjoy playing and watching many different sports including rugby,
            basketball, and football. My favorite teams in these respective sports are the All
            Blacks, the Golden State Warriors, and Arsenal FC.</p>

        <p>Blessed with golden sand beaches on the east, and wild black-sand surf beaches on the
            west, Auckland also boasts over 50
            volcanoes, two natural harbours, and mountain ranges covered in dense green
            flora, home to hundreds of species of native insects, and birds.</p>
